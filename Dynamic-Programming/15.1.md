### Exercises 15.1-1
***
Show how to modify the PRINT-STATIONS procedure to print out the stations in increasing order of station number. (Hint: Use recursion.)

### `Answer`


### Exercises 15.1-2
***
Use equations (15.8) and (15.9) and the substitution method to show that ri(j), the number of references made to fi[j] in a recursive algorithm, equals 2^(n - j).

### `Answer`


### Exercises 15.1-3
***
Using the result of Exercise 15.1-2, show that the total number of references to all fi[j] values, or ï¿¼

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\sum_{j%20=%201}^{n}r_i\(j\))
 , is exactly 2^(n+1) - 2.



### `Answer`

				

### Exercises 15.1-4
***
Together, the tables containing fi[j] and li[j] values contain a total of 4n - 2 entries. Show how to reduce the space requirements to a total of 2n + 2 entries, while still computing f* and still being able to print all the stations on a fastest way through the factory.

### `Answer`
It's simple. When we calculate f(n),we just need f(n-1).so we just alloc f1[2] and f2[2].
			
			
### Exercises 15.1-5
***
Professor Canty conjectures that there might exist some ei, ai,j, and ti,j values for which FASTEST-WAY produces li[j] values such that l1[j] = 2 and l2[j] = 1 for some station number j. Assuming that all transfer costs ti,j are nonnegative, show that the professor is wrong.


### `Answer`
if l1[j] = 2,then f1[j-1]>f2[j-1]+t(2,j-1) ------  @1

if l2[j] = 1,then f2[j-1]>f1[j-1]+t(1,j-1) ------  @2

we add @1 and @2,find that t(1,j-1)+t(2,j-1) < 0  wrong !!!!!!
