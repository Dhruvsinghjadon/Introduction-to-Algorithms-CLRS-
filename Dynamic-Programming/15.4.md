### Exercises 15.4-1
***
Determine an LCS of <1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1> and <0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0>.

### `Answer`
The LCS is <1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0> , Or It can be <1,0,1,0,1,0>



### Exercises 15.4-2
***
Show how to reconstruct an LCS from the completed c table and the original sequences X =
<x1, x2, ..., xm> and Y = <y1, y2, ..., yn> in O(m +n) time, without using the b table.

### `Answer`

	PRINT_LCS(c, x, y, i, j)
		if i = 0 || j = 0
			return
		if x[i] = y[j]
			PRINT_LCS(c, x, y, i-1, j-1)
			print x[i]
		elif c[i-1, j] >= c[i, j-1]
			PRINT_LCS(c, x, y, i-1, j)
		else
			PRINT_LCS(c, x, y, i, j-1)

***
Give a memoized version of LCS-LENGTH that runs in O(mn) time.

### `Answer`

	LCS-LENGTH(X, Y)
		m ← length[X]
		n ← length[Y]
		for i ← 1 to m do
			for j ← 1 to n do
				c[i,j] ← -1
			end for
		end for
		return LOOKUP-LENGTH(X,Y,m,n)
		
	LOOKUP-LENGTH(X,Y,i,j)
		if c[i,j] > -1 then
			return c[i,j]
		end if
		if i = 0 or j = 0 then
			c[i,j] ← 0
		else
			if X[i] = Y[j] then
				c[i,j] ← LOOKUP-LENGTH(X,Y,i-1,j-1)+1
			else
				c[i,j] ← max(LOOKUP-LENGTH(X,Y,i,j-1),LOOKUP-LENGTH(X,Y,i-1,j))
			end if
		end if
		return c[i,j]
		
### Exercises 15.4-4
***
Show how to compute the length of an LCS using only 2 · min(m, n) entries in the c table plus O(1) additional space. Then show how to do this using min(m, n) entries plus O(1) additional space.

### `Answer`

Since we need only c[i-1,j-1], c[i,j-1], c[i-1,j] to compute c[i,j], we just need to save the previous row and the current row of the dp table. We will maintain the row parallel to the shorter one of the X and Y strings. So we can run the algorithm with 2 · min(m, n) space.

In fact, we only need to save only one row. c[i,j-1] is already stored in this row. Then, we use an extra variable to maintain c[i-1,j-1]. Every time c[i,j] is updated, the value of c[i-1,j] is saved into the extra variable because it will be used next time.

### Exercises 15.4-5
***
Give an O(n^2)-time algorithm to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of a sequence of n numbers.

### `Answer`
Method 1:
Given a sequence X = <x1,x2,...,xn> we wish to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence. 

1. First we sort the string X which produces sequence X'.

2. Finding the longest common subsequence of X and X' yields the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of X.

The running time is O(n^2) since sorting can be done in O(nlgn) and the call to LCS-LENGTH is O(n^2). 

Method 2:
	LONGEST-INC-SEQUENCE(Arr, n)
		len [1...n] be a new array
		for i←1 to n
			len[i] ← 1	// length of longest increasing sequence ending at i.
		for i←2 to n do
			for j←1 to i-1 do
				if Arr[j] < Arr[i]
					len [i] ← max(len[i], len[j] +1)
				end if
			end for
		end for
		return len [n]

***
Give an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to find the longest monotonically increasing sub-sequence of a sequence of n numbers. (Hint: Observe that the last element of a candidate subsequence of length i is at least as large as the last element of a candidate subsequence of length i - 1. Maintain candidate subsequences by linking them through the input sequence.)
