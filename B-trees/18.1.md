### Exercises 18.1-1
***
Why don't we allow a minimum degree of t = 1?

### `Answer`
According to the definition, minimum degree t means every node other than the root must have at least t – 1 keys, and every internal node other than the root thus has at least t children. So, when t = 1, it means every node other than the root must have
at least t – 1 = 0 key, and every internal node other than the root thus has at least t = 1 child.

Thus, we can see that the minimum case doesn't exist, because no node exists with 0 key, and no node exists with only 1 child
in a B-tree.
