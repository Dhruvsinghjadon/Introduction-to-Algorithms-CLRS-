### Exercises 18.1-1
***
Why don't we allow a minimum degree of t = 1?

### `Answer`
According to the definition, minimum degree t means every node other than the root must have at least t – 1 keys, and every internal node other than the root thus has at least t children. So, when t = 1, it means every node other than the root must have
at least t – 1 = 0 key, and every internal node other than the root thus has at least t = 1 child.

Thus, we can see that the minimum case doesn't exist, because no node exists with 0 key, and no node exists with only 1 child
in a B-tree.

### Exercises 18.1-2
***
For what values of t is the tree of Figure 18.1 a legal B-tree?

### `Answer`
According to property 5 of B-tree, every node other than the root must have at least t−1keys and may contain at most 2t−1 keys. In Figure 18.1, the number of keys of each node (except the root) is either 2 or 3. So to make it a legal B-tree, we need
to guarantee that

t – 1 ≤ 2 and 2 t – 1 ≥ 3,

which yields 2 ≤ t ≤ 3. So t can be 2 or 3.
