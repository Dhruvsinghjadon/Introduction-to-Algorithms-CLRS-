Exercises 12.1-1
For the set of keys {1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 17, 21}, draw binary search trees of height 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Exercises 12.1-2
What is the difference between the binary-search-tree property and the min-heap property (see page 129)? Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an n-node tree in sorted order in O(n) time? Explain how or why not.

Exercises 12.1-3
Give a nonrecursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk. (Hint: There is an easy solution that uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure and a more complicated but elegant solution that uses no stack but assumes that two point- ers can be tested for equality.)

Exercises 12.1-4
Give recursive algorithms that perform preorder and postorder tree walks in Θ (n) time on a tree of n nodes.

Exercises 12.1-5
Argue that since sorting n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case.
