Exercises 5.2-1
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you will hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you will hire exactly n times?

Exercises 5.2-2
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you will hire exactly twice?

Exercises 5.2-3
Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of n dice.

Exercises 5.2-4
Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the hat- check problem. Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat- check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers that get back their own hat?

Exercises 5.2-5
Let A[1...n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that each element of A is chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from the range 1 through n. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.
