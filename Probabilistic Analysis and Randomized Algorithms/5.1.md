### Exercises 5.1-1
***
Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is best in line 4 of procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT implies that we know a total order on the ranks of the candidates.

### `Answer`
**always**


### Exercises 5.1-2
***
Describe an implementation of the procedure RANDOM(a, b) that only makes calls to RANDOM(0, 1). What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of a and b?

### `Answer`
Without loss of generality we may assume that a = 0. Otherwise we can generate a random number between 0 and b âˆ’ a, then add a to it.



Each iteration of the while loop takes O(n) time to run. The probability that the while loop stops on a given iteration is (b+1)/(2^n). Thus the expected running time is the expected number of iterations of the while-loop times
n. This is given by:



Since we assume a = 0 in the first, the final running time is:  O(lg(b-a))

But this algorithm is non-deterministic.



### Exercises 5.1-3
***
Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p, where 0 < p < 1, but you do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of p?

### `Answer`
	while true:
		x = BIASED-RANDOM()
		y = BIASED-RANDOM()
		if x != y:
			return x

expected running time = 1/(2p(1-p))
