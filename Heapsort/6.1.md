### Exercises 6.1-1
***
What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height h?

### `Answer`


What it is a perfect complete tree, it is 2^(h+1) - 1; when the last level has only one element, we have 2^h.

### Exercises 6.1-2
***
Show that an n-element heap has height ⌞lg n⌟

### `Answer`



### Exercises 6.1-3
***
Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.

### `Answer`

This is the property of maximum heap.

### Exercises 6.1-4
***
Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct?

### `Answer`
It must be in the leaf node.

### Exercises 6.1-5
***
Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

### `Answer`


We don't know whether it's an increasing order or descending order.

### Exercises 6.1-6
***
Is the sequence [23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12] a max-heap?

### `Answer`
NO, because 7 > 6

### Exercises 6.1-7
***
Show that, with the array representation for storing an n-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by ⌞n/2⌟ + 1, ⌞n/2⌟ + 2, ... , n.

### `Answer`


It is easy to conclude, every time we add two nodes, the index of leaf nodes will increase 1.
