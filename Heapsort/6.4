Exercises 6.4-1
Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of HEAPSORT on the array A = [5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4].
Exercises 6.4-2
Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant:

• At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2-5, the subarray A[1...i] is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of A[1...n], and the subarray A[i + 1...n] contains the n - i largest elements of A[1...n], sorted.
Exercises 6.4-3
What is the running time of heapsort on an array A of length n that is already sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?
Exercises 6.4-4
Show that the worst-case running time of heapsort is Ω(n lg n).
Exercises 6.4-5
Show that when all elements are distinct, the best-case running time of heapsort is Ω(n lg n).
