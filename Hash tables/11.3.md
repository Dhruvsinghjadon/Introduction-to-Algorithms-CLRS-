Exercises 11.3-1
Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key?

Exercises 11.3-2
Suppose that a string of r characters is hashed into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. The number m is easily represented as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself?

Exercises 11.3-3
Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2p - 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2p. Show that if string x can be derived from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.

Exercises 11.3-4
Consider a hash table of size m = 1000 and a corresponding hash function h(k) = ⌊m(k A mod 1)⌋ for  . Compute the locations to which the keys 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65 are mapped.
