### Exercise 17.4-3
***
Suppose that instead of contracting a table by halving its size when its load factor drops below 1/4, we contract it by multiplying its size by 2/3 when its load factor drops below 1/3. Using the potential function

$$ Φ(T) = |2 · num[T] - size[T]| $$ ,

show that the amortized cost of a TABLE-DELETE that uses this strategy is bounded above by a constant.
