Exercises 8.2-1
Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of COUNTING-SORT on the array A = [6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2].
Exercises 8.2-2
Suppose that the for loop header in line 9 of the COUNTING-SORT procedure is rewritten

as 9 for j ← 1 to length[A]

Show that the algorithm still works properly. Is the modified algorithm stable?
Exercises 8.2-4
Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range 0 to k, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the n integers fall into a range [a...b] in O(1) time. Your algorithm should use Θ(n + k) preprocessing time.
