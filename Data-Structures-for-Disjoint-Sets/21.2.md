### Exercises 21.2-1
***
Write pseudocode for MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, and UNION using the linked-list representation and the weighted-union heuristic. Assume that each object x has an attribute rep[x] pointing to the representative of the set containing x and that each set S has attributes head[S], tail[S], and size[S] (which equals the length of the list).

### `Answer`

	MAKE-SET(x):
		Initialize a new linked list
		Insert node x
	
	FIND-SET(x):
		return rep[x]
		
	UNION(x, y):
		Let smallist,biglist be the list with less and larger list according to size[x],size[y]
		put smallist to the tail in biglist

### Exercises 21.2-2
***
Show the data structure that results and the answers returned by the FIND-SET operations in the following program. Use the linked-list representation with the weighted-union heuristic.

	for i <- 1 to 16
		do MAKE-SET(x_i)
	for i <- 1 to 15 by 2
		do UNION(x_i,x_i+1)
	for i <- 1 to 13 by 4
		do UNION(x_i, x_i+2)
	UNION(x1,x5)
	UNION(x11,x13)
	UNION(x1,x_10)
	FIND-SET(x2)
	FIND-SET(x9)
	
Assume that if the sets containing xi and xj have the same size, then the operation UNION(xi, xj) appends xj's list onto xi's list.

### `Answer`
All x are in the same set, all return 1.
